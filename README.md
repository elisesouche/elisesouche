Hi, I'm @elisesouche!

I am a math, physics, and computer science student.
My interests are mostly in programming languages, compilers, and interpreters.
I am a firm free software advocate.

My main project currently is a Lua interpreter. I am also an occasional contributor to [NixOS](https://github.com/nixos).

By the way, you should consider reducing your reliance on GitHub, which is non-free software made by Microsoft.

Pronouns: she/her or they/them in English, elle in French.
